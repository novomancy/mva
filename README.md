Minimum Viable Annotator using SAT

This is a basic implementation of the [Semantic Annotation Tool](https://github.com/novomancy/Waldorf) that adds a web annotation interface around a directory of .mp4 files. This version is protected by an external CAS auth call and thus requires a Dartmouth College NetID to use, but that authorization step can be stripped out or replaced with your own.
